# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used terminal-table to add a table and border around the list.  If I kept working
at it I could have separated more columns but I liked at least the aesthetic of
having a border around the list and separating the number from the description.  It
is a good start and introduction to what the gem is capable of.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I added an additional list item called wish.  I think wish lists are very
  popular and a good feature to add.
  b) I added an update priority option.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Probably about 5 hours.  It took a good 3 HOURS to figure out why my WishItem was
giving me a Constant Error.  Of course it was as simple as forgetting to require
lib/wish in by udacilist.rb file.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding is figuring something out when it seems to keep going wrong.
There are a lot of times that I feel like I keep failing at something, but once
you keep doing the research and finally get back on track it is very rewarding.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I added an additional list item called wish.  You can now add "Wish list" items.
I feel like a lot of people use lists to create wish lists or bucket lists.  This
would make this app more useful to a wider audience.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Still working on growing my fluidity.
