# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Probably about 5 hours.  It took a good 3 HOURS to figure out why my WishItem was
giving me a Constant Error.  Of course it was as simple as forgetting to require
lib/wish in by udacilist.rb file.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
