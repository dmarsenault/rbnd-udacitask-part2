# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used terminal-table to add a table and border around the list.  If I kept working
at it I could have separated more columns but I liked at least the aesthetic of
having a border around the list and separating the number from the description.  It
is a good start and introduction to what the gem is capable of.
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I added an additional list item called wish.  I think wish lists are very
  popular and a good feature to add.
  b) Feature 2...

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Probably about 5 hours.  It took a good 3 HOURS to figure out why my WishItem was
giving me a Constant Error.  Of course it was as simple as forgetting to require
lib/wish in by udacilist.rb file.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
